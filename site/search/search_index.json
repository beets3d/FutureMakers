These motors are strategically positioned to optimize the walking mechanism, allowing for smooth and coordinated leg movements. The geared design enhances the efficiency of power transfer, ensuring that the robot can navigate various terrains effectively.     </p> <ul> <li>Leg (left / right) - consists of a leg with a mechanism that simulates walking in a pendulum motion. This design allows the leg to move back and forth smoothly, mimicking how a human leg walks. The foot includes a LEGO-compatible attachment, making it easy to customize and change the foot design. This feature encourages experimentation with different shapes and sizes to see how they affect the robot's movement and balance.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Electronics    - Main Board - Serves as the central hub for the robot, featuring a dedicated slot for the micro:bit unit, which acts as the brain. It integrates the motor driver and facilitates seamless connectivity to both the motors and the battery pack, ensuring efficient power distribution and control.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Micro:bit - The Micro:bit is a compact, versatile microcontroller designed for educational purposes. It features a range of sensors, buttons, and LED lights, making it an ideal choice for programming and robotics projects. In this robot, the Micro:bit acts as the brain, controlling the motors and processing inputs from the user. </p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>Battery Cases - The battery cases are designed to securely hold the power source for the robot, ensuring that the batteries are protected and easily accessible for replacement. A well-designed battery case contributes to the overall stability of the robot by maintaining a low center of gravity, which is crucial for effective walking. Proper weight distribution helps prevent tipping and enhances the robot's balance during movement.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Outter Shell    - Body- This is the main body of the walking robot, designed to house the internal components and provide structural support for the legs and head.       </p> <ul> <li>Head - This component serves as the robot's head, providing a visual representation and housing any necessary sensors or features for interaction. This can be customised according the learning needs.       </li> <li>Outer Shell - This component provides the external casing for the robot, giving a nice outlook and customise base any requirements. </li> </ul> <p>Remote Control You can use another Micro:bit to control the walking pattern by pressing the A or B button. Each button corresponds to the movement of one leg; pressing a button will make the associated leg step forward. For example, let's assume the A button controls the left leg and the B button controls the right leg. When you press the A button, the left leg will step forward, and when you press the B button, the right leg will step forward. This setup allows you to manage the timing and motion of both legs, providing an opportunity to explore how \"control timing\" affects balance, speed, and direction during walking.</p> <p>Customization Options    - LEGO attachment - Foot is designed to allow any LEGO attachment to be added        </p> <ul> <li>Adjustable leg lengths - With the LEGO attachment, you can adjust the length of the legs by adding LEGO blocks, which will change the range of motion for each steps.</li> <li>Adjustable foot shape - You can also design the any shapes to test out the different effect to walking behavior, taking consideration of balance.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/walking-robot/#assembly-guide","title":"Assembly Guide","text":"<p>For detailed assembly instructions, please refer to the Assembly Guide.</p>"},{"location":"projects/walking-robot/#lesson-plan","title":"Lesson Plan","text":""},{"location":"projects/walking-robot/#course-objectives","title":"Course Objectives:","text":"<ul> <li>Understand walking mechanics (balance, torque, gait patterns).</li> <li>Design and build a functional walking robot using the B3D1 kit.

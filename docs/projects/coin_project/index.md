# Coin Design Project

---

## Abstract

This is a hands-on, project-based course that guides you through the process of designing your own original coin using AI tools, refining the design in a 3D sculpting app, and preparing it for 3D printing or minting. The course combines creative design, digital modeling, and physical prototyping, allowing you to create a unique commemorative or fantasy coin.

- Techniques to import, clean, and refine models using Nomad Sculpt (or similar)
- Customization of coin features such as relief, edge, and text
- Preparing and slicing models for 3D printing or minting
- Basics of 3D printing and post-processing techniques
- Presenting and photographing your final product

## Project Steps

### 1. Generating the Coin Design

**Objective**: Create an initial coin motif and design using AI tools.

**Content**:
1. Learn and practice AI prompts to generate coin motifs (e.g., animals, symbols, portraits)
2. Use AI image generation tools to create reference images for the coin's obverse and reverse
3. Select your favorite design and prepare it for 3D modeling

Example AI-generated coin motif:

### 2. Modeling the Coin

**Objective**: Sculpt the coin in 3D based on your chosen motif.

**Content**:
1. Create a circular base in Nomad Sculpt (or similar)
2. Import the AI-generated motif as a reference image
3. Sculpt the relief onto the coin face using sculpting tools
4. Add text (e.g., denomination, year, country, or custom message)
5. Add edge details (reeded, smooth, or custom pattern)

### 3. Preparing for 3D Printing

**Objective**: Export and print your coin model.

**Content**:
1. Export the finished coin as an STL file
2. Import into slicer software
   - Adjust orientation for best print quality
   - Add supports if needed
   - Configure print settings (layer height, infill, etc.)
3. Generate G-code and print the coin

### 4. Post-Processing and Finishing

1. Remove supports and clean up the print
2. Sand and polish the coin for a smooth finish
3. Paint or plate the coin for a metallic look (gold, silver, bronze, etc.)
4. Photograph your finished coin

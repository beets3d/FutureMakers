# Zodiac Coin Design Project

---

## Abstract

This hands-on project guides you through the process of designing and creating your own custom Zodiac Coin using tools, digital sculpting, and 3D printing. You'll learn how to generate unique coin designs based on zodiac signs, refine them in Nomad Sculpt, and produce a physical coin using a 3D printer. This project blends creativity, digital modeling, and practical prototyping.

## Project Steps


### 1. Creating the 3D Coin Model

**Objective**: Building a 3D coin model.

**Content**:
1. Use Fusion tools to create a raised relief based on the image.
2. Create a 12-sided polygon base:
   - Use the "Polygon" tool in Fusion 360
   - Set the number of sides to 12
   - Draw the polygon with appropriate diameter (e.g., 30-40mm)
   - Extrude the polygon to create a coin thickness (2-3mm)

3. Create the coin relief:
   - Import or create your zodiac symbol design
   - Use the "Extrude" tool to create raised relief on the front face
   - Adjust the extrude depth (typically 0.5-1mm for good visibility)
   - Use "Fillet" tool to round the edges for a more realistic coin appearance

4. Add text and details:
   - Use the "Text" tool to add zodiac name and months
   - Position text elements on the coin face
   - Use "Extrude" to create raised text or "Cut" for engraved text
   - Add decorative border patterns using sketch tools and extrude/cut operations

5. Create the reverse side:
   - Mirror or create a new design for the back of the coin
   - Add complementary details, symbols, or text
   - Ensure both sides are properly aligned

6. Finalize the design:
   - Add a small hole in the center if desired (for hanging/display)
   - Apply fillets to all sharp edges for safety and aesthetics
   - Check that the model is manifold and ready for 3D printing

### 2. Preparing for 3D Printing

**Objective**: Export and slice your coin model for printing.

**Content**:
1. Export the finished coin model from Fusion 360 in STL format.
2. Import the STL into your slicer software (e.g., Bambu Studio).
3. Adjust orientation for best print quality (face up recommended).
4. Configure print settings:
   - Layer height: 0.1-0.2mm for detail
   - Infill: 100% for solid feel
   - Supports: May not be needed if printing face up
5. Slice and preview the print.

### 3. Printing and Post-Processing

**Objective**: Print and finish your Zodics Coin.

**Content**:
1. Print the coin using your 3D printer.
2. Remove the print and clean up any rough edges or supports.
3. Sand the surfaces for a smooth finish.
4. (Optional) Paint the coin with metallic paints for a realistic look.

## Optional Projects

### Multi-Material Coins
- Experiment with dual-color or multi-material printing for contrast between the symbol and background.
- Print the coin with metal material or paint it with metal painting tools for presenting in lustrous and shiny surface and metallic texture.

### Coin Display Stand
- Design and print a small stand to display your finished coin.

### Custom Zodiac Series
- Create a full set of coins, one for each zodiac sign, and present them as a collection.

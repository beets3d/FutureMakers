# Vehicle Design Project

---

## Abstract

This is a hands-on, project-based course that guides you through the process of creating a customized 3D car model using AI tools, refining it in Nomad Sculpt, 3D printing it, and transforming it into a fully functional 4WD remote-controlled (RC) vehicle. The course combines creative design, digital modeling, physical prototyping, assembly.

## Project Steps

### 1. Generating the 3D Model

**Objective**: Create an initial 3D car model using AI tools.

**Content**:
1. Learn and practice AI prompts and generate a blank car model using ChatGPT
2. Use Tripo AI to generate a 3D model:
   - Upload your reference image
   - Adjust generation parameters as needed
   - Download the generated 3D model

Use the image to generate a car 3D model using Tripo AI

### 2. Model Modification

**Objective**: Customize the car model's appearance.

**Content**:
1. Import the generated model into Nomad Sculpt
2. Remesh the model(Preferrably Quad Remesh Tool)
3. Learn about basic car customisation options
4. Use basic modification tools:
   - Masking tool for maintaining certain parts
   - Move and Drag tool for reshaping windshield and overall shape
   - Clay for skirts, fender and smooth it
   - Clay, move and smooth for front bumper and rear bumper
   - Use Primitives and trim tool for spoilers
   - Smooth tool for evening out rough spots

5. Assemble a Tamiya 4WD chassis and learn how the vehicle works and how it is assembled.
![Chassis 1](./images/chassis.jpg)
![Chassis 2](./images/chassis2.jpg)
6. Shell the car cover
Boolean all the parts and mask outer surface of the car
![masking](./images/mask.png)

Use extract with 0.01 shell thickness to create the car shell.
![extract](./images/extract.png)
![shell](./images/shell.png)



7. Import the given Boolean unit. This boolean unit is on scale and simulates the shape of the Chassis, as well as the two joints that will be combined with the car cover.
Boolean unit
![booleanunit](./images/boolean-unit.png)
Joint unit
![jointunit](./images/joint-unit.png)
Use gizmo, drag, move to adjust the car cover to fit on top of the boolean unit and fit the wheel position
Before
![boolean1](./images/boolean1.png)
After
![boolean2](./images/boolean2.png)
Use boolean, subtract the Boolean unit from the car cover, to ensure there are no overlapping parts while assembling the car cover onto the chassis.
![boolean3](./images/boolean3.png)
Use boolean to combine the front and rear joints from the Joint Unit, and remove the excessive parts.
![boolean4](./images/boolean4.png)
Then the car cover is complete and ready for printing.

### 3. Preparing for 3D Printing

**Objective**: Export the 3D model for printing.

**Content**:
1. Export model from Nomad in STL format
2. Import into slicer software:
   - Adjust model orientation for optimal printing
   - Add support structures
   - Configure print settings (layer height, infill, etc.)
3. Generate G-code and print

Slicer Setup (Bambu Studio)

### 4. Post-processing, assembly and test running
1. Remove support structures
2. sand the surfaces and support structure marks
3. Assemble the car cover onto the Chassis

Printed model with support

If it doesn't fit then adjust the model again.

Now test run on the Tamiya racing tracks

## Optional Projects 

### 3D scanning
   - 3D scanning can be used instead of AI model generation. Students can experience the process of scanning real life toy cars and import them into Nomad.
   - Scanned models takes more time and proficiency to fix so this is not recommended for first timers.
   - 3D scanner is required 

### Wind Tunnel Testing 
   - Learn about the basic aerodynamic principles and the usage of a wind tunnel
   - Test different car designs for aerodynamic efficiency
   - Observe the behaviour of Streamlines and compare them for different student designs
   - Document results and make design improvements
   - This is mainly aimed towards Physics/Engineering related students
   - Desktop wind tunnel is required

### painting
   - Paint the printed car cover
   - Let students be creatie with their design
   - Learn different types of painting tools and techniques

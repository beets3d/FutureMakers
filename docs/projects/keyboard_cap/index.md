# Keyboard Cap Design Project
## Abstract

This hands-on project guides you through the process of designing and creating your own custom Donut-themed keyboard cap using digital sculpting and 3D printing. You'll learn how to conceptualize a playful donut design, refine it in Nomad Sculpt and/or Fusion 360, and produce a unique keycap for your mechanical keyboard. This project your blends creativity, digital modeling, and practical prototyping.

## Project Steps

### 1. Creating the 3D Donut Keycap Model

**Objective**: Build a 3D model of a donut-themed keyboard cap.

**Content**:
1. Research and sketch your donut design (classic ring, frosting, sprinkles, etc.).
2. In Nomad Sculpt or Fusion 360:
   - Start with a cylinder or torus shape for the donut base.
   - Sculpt the frosting layer on top, letting it drip over the sides.
   - Hollow out the bottom and add an MX-style keycap stem (use a reference model for fit).
3. Refine the model:
   - Smooth out rough areas.
   - Ensure the stem is properly aligned and sized for your keyboard switch.
   - Check for overhangs and printability.

### 2. Preparing for 3D Printing

**Objective**: Export and slice your donut keycap model for printing.

**Content**:
1. Export the finished keycap model in STL format.
2. Import the STL into your slicer software (e.g., Bambu Studio).
3. Adjust orientation for best print quality (stem down recommended).
4. Configure print settings:
   - Layer height: 0.1-0.2mm for detail
   - Infill: 100% or high for strength
   - Supports: Enable for overhanging frosting/sprinkles
5. Slice and preview the print.

### 3. Printing and Post-Processing

**Objective**: Print and finish your donut keycap.

**Content**:
1. Print the keycap using your 3D printer.
2. Remove the print and clean up any supports or rough edges.
3. Sand the surfaces for a smooth finish, especially the stem area.
4. (Optional) Paint the donut:
   - Use acrylics for the base, frosting, and sprinkles.
   - Add gloss or matte varnish for realism.

5. Test fit the keycap on your keyboard. Make adjustments if needed.

## Optional Projects

### Multi-Color Printing
- Use multi-material or color-changing filament to print the frosting and base in different colors.

### Other Food-Themed Keycaps
- Design and print a series of food-themed keycaps (e.g., burger, pizza, sushi) for a fun keyboard set.

### Keycap Display Stand
- Design and print a small stand to display your donut keycap when not in use.

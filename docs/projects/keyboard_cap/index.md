# Keyboard Cap Design Project
## Abstract

This hands-on project guides you through the process of designing and creating your own customised keyboard cap using digital sculpting and 3D printing. You'll learn how to produce a keycap for your mechanical keyboard, and then add your own design on top of the keycap. This project blends creativity, digital modeling, and practical prototyping.

## Project Steps - Adapting the Project to Skill Level
This project can be tailored to different experience levels, from beginners to advanced makers. Hereâ€™s how you can approach each step: 

### 1. Creating a customised keycap

**Objective**: Build a 3D model of the key cap

- **Contents:**

- **Advanced:**  
  - Start by carefully measuring an existing MX-style keycap using calipers or a ruler.
  - Record key measurements such as width, height, stem size, and overall profile. 
  - Optionally, refer to a mechanical drawing or datasheet for precise specifications.
  - In Fusion 360, create the keycap base using your measured dimensions or the provided mechanical drawing.
  - Model the MX-style stem to ensure compatibility with your keyboard switches.
  - Design a customised keycap in Fusion 360 or Nomad Sculpt and combine it with the existing keycap base.
  - Export your finished model as an STL file, slice and print it, then post-process (remove supports, sand, and paint) for a realistic finish.

- **Intermediate:**  
  - Use the provided mechanical drawing or reference model for the keycap stem and base dimensions.
  - Model the keycap base in Fusion 360, ensuring the stem fits MX-style switches.
  - Design a customised keycap in Fusion 360 or Nomad Sculpt and combine it with the existing keycap base.
  - Export, slice, print, and finish your keycap as above.

- **Beginner/Younger Groups:**  
  - Skip the measuring and base modelling steps. Use the pre-made keycap stem model instead.
  - Focus on the creative aspects: in Nomad Sculpt or Fusion 360, create your own design, and attach it to the provided base.
  - Export, slice, print, and paint your keycap.


Here's an example of customised Donut Keycap built in Fusion:

And then combined with the base keycap model:

**Tip:**  
Beginners and younger makers can focus on the creative aspect, using a provided keycap base and stem to ensure a good fit. Advanced users can challenge themselves by modeling every part from scratch.


### 2. Prepare for 3D Printing

**Objective**: Export and slice the keycap model for printing.

**Contents:**

1. Export the finished keycap model in STL format.
2. Import the STL into your slicer software (e.g., Bambu Studio).
3. Adjust orientation for best print quality.
4. Configure print settings:
   - Layer height: 0.08-0.1mm for detail
   - Infill: 10% or high
   - Supports: Enable for tree support
4. Slice and preview the print.

### 3. Finish Your Customised Keycap

**Objective**: Post-process the customised keycap.

**Content**:

**Post-Processing**  
   - Remove the print and clean up any supports or rough edges.
   - Sand the surfaces for a smooth finish, especially the stem area.
   - (Optional) Paint the your model:
     - Use acrylic paint to make the model more colourful.
     - Add gloss or matte varnish for different effects.

4. Test fit the keycap on your keyboard. Make adjustments if needed.

**Tip:**  
- Beginners and younger makers can focus on steps 3 and 4, using a provided keycap base.
- Intermediate students can try with a given drawing.
- Advanced students are encouraged to start from scratch, measuring and modeling the keycap base themselves for a complete engineering and design experience.

## Optional Projects

### Multi-Color Printing
- Use multi-color filament to print the frosting and base in different colors.

### Other Food-Themed Keycaps
- Design and print a series of food-themed keycaps (e.g., burger, pizza, sushi) for a fun keyboard set.

### Keycap Display Stand
- Design and print a small stand to display your donut keycap when not in use.

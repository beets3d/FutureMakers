## Project Steps - Adapting the Project to Skill Level
This project can be tailored to different experience levels, from beginners to advanced makers. Hereâ€™s how you can approach each step: 

### 1. Creating the 3D Donut Keycap Model

**Objective**: Build a 3D model of a donut-themed keyboard cap.

- **Contents:**

- **Advanced:**  
  - Start by carefully measuring an existing MX-style keycap using calipers or a ruler.
  - Record key measurements such as width, height, stem size, and overall profile. 
  - Optionally, refer to a mechanical drawing or datasheet for precise specifications.
  - In Fusion 360, create the keycap base using your measured dimensions or the provided mechanical drawing.
  - Model the MX-style stem to ensure compatibility with your keyboard switches.
  - Design the donut-themed top of the keycap in Fusion 360 or Nomad Sculpt, blending the creative donut shape, frosting, and sprinkles with the functional base.
  - Export your finished model as an STL file, slice and print it, then post-process (remove supports, sand, and paint) for a realistic finish.

- **Intermediate:**  
  - Use a provided mechanical drawing or reference model for the keycap stem and base dimensions.
  - Model the keycap base in Fusion 360, ensuring the stem fits MX-style switches.
  - Focus on designing the donut-themed top in Fusion 360 or Nomad Sculpt, adding creative details.
  - Export, slice, print, and finish your keycap as above.

- **Beginner/Younger Groups:**  
  - Skip the measuring and base modeling steps. Use a pre-made keycap stem model or template.
  - Focus on the creative aspects: in Nomad Sculpt or Fusion 360, sculpt the donut shape, add frosting and sprinkles, and attach it to the provided base.
  - Export, slice, print, and paint your keycap.

**Tip:**  
Beginners and younger makers can focus on the creative sculpting and painting steps, using a provided keycap base and stem to ensure a good fit. Advanced users can challenge themselves by modeling every part from scratch for a fully custom result.

### 2. Model the Keycap Base and Prepare for 3D Printing

**Objective**: Export and slice your donut keycap model for printing.

**Contents:**

- **Advanced/Intermediate:**  
  - In Fusion 360, create the keycap base using your measured dimensions or a provided mechanical drawing. Model the MX-style stem to ensure compatibility with your keyboard switches.
  - Once your base and stem are modeled, design the donut-themed top and merge it with the base.
  - Export the finished keycap model in STL format.

- **Beginner:**  
  - Use a ready-made keycap base or import a reference model, focusing on the creative aspects like sculpting the donut, frosting, and sprinkles.
  - Attach your creative design to the provided base and export the combined model as an STL file.

1. Export the finished keycap model in STL format.
2. Import the STL into your slicer software (e.g., Bambu Studio).
3. Adjust orientation for best print quality (stem down recommended).
4. Configure print settings:
   - Layer height: 0.1-0.2mm for detail
   - Infill: 100% or high for strength
   - Supports: Enable for overhanging frosting/sprinkles
4. Slice and preview the print.

### 3. Design, Print, and Finish Your Donut Keycap

**Objective**: Create, print, and finish your donut-themed keycap.

**Content**:

1. **Design the Aesthetics**  
   - In Fusion 360 or Nomad Sculpt, design the donut-themed top of the keycap:
     - Sculpt the donut shape, add frosting, and sprinkle details.
     - Blend the creative design with the functional keycap base.
     - Beginners can focus on this step, using a pre-made base and stem.

2. **Print the Keycap**  
   - Export your finished model as an STL file.
   - Print the keycap using your 3D printer.

3. **Post-Processing**  
   - Remove the print and clean up any supports or rough edges.
   - Sand the surfaces for a smooth finish, especially the stem area.
   - (Optional) Paint the donut:
     - Use acrylics for the base, frosting, and sprinkles.
     - Add gloss or matte varnish for realism.

4. Test fit the keycap on your keyboard. Make adjustments if needed.

**Tip:**  
- Beginners and younger makers can focus on steps 3 and 4, using a provided keycap base.
- Intermediate students can try with a given drawing.
- Advanced students are encouraged to start from scratch, measuring and modeling the keycap base themselves for a complete engineering and design experience.

## Optional Projects

### Multi-Color Printing
- Use multi-material or color-changing filament to print the frosting and base in different colors.

### Other Food-Themed Keycaps
- Design and print a series of food-themed keycaps (e.g., burger, pizza, sushi) for a fun keyboard set.

### Keycap Display Stand
- Design and print a small stand to display your donut keycap when not in use.

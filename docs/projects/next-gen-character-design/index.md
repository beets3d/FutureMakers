## What is this?

This is a creative learning activity that combines AI generation, character design, and digital modeling. Students will start from their own traits and styles, use AI tools (such as ChatGPT/Doubao AI, Tripo) to spark inspiration and generate character appearances, then further use Nomad Sculpt for character modeling and part splitting, and finally 3D print their physical works.

From concept to model to physical work, students are encouraged to create their own original characters and build basic concepts of digital modeling and 3D printing.

## Key Features

- Use AI tools to brainstorm original character themes, integrating personal style and ideas.
- Develop character appearance, style, accessories, and personality, training narrative and visual transformation abilities.
- Experience the complete creative process: from creative ideation/AI inspiration → modeling → part splitting → printing → painting.
- Encourage the development of personal artistic style, strengthening creative thinking and expressive ability.

This is an immersive creative experience combining technology and art—not just making a cute character, but creating a one-of-a-kind, unique character.

## What will you learn?

Students will personally complete the creative ideation, appearance design, and 3D model realization of their characters, cultivating the following core abilities:

**Creative Ideation and Character Design Thinking**

- Use ChatGPT/Doubao AI to create reference images for character appearance design.
- Use Tripo AI to generate the prototype of the character's 3D model.

**Digital Modeling and Sculpting Skills**

- Use Nomad Sculpt to modify models, build structure, and sculpt details.
- Master symmetrical modeling, proportion adjustment, and basic part splitting techniques.

**Digital to Physical Operation**

- Model part splitting and export STL/OBJ files.
- Use slicing software to set 3D printing parameters.
- Understand the 3D printing process and post-processing.

**Artistic Expression and Style Painting**

- Learn basic acrylic painting techniques for models.
- Practice color design for consistent character style.

## How it works

The production process is as follows:

1. AI Inspiration Generation: Use ChatGPT/Doubao AI to assist in generating reference images.
2. AI Model Prototyping: Use Tripo to generate 3D model prototypes and basic part splitting.
3. 3D Modeling Modification: Import into Nomad, adjust appearance, sculpt details, and adjust part components.
4. Part Export: Disassemble components and export STL/OBJ.
5. 3D Printing: Print single-color models.
6. Painting and Assembly: Hand-paint and assemble parts to complete the physical character.

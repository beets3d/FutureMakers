## Project Steps – Adapting the Ballista Blitz to Your Skill Level
This project is designed for all makers, from beginners to advanced engineers. Here’s how you can approach each step:

### 1. Building Your Ping Pong Ballista

**Objective**: Design and model a working ping pong ballista.

- **Contents:**

- **Advanced:**  
  - Start by researching create your ballista or crossbow mechanisms.
  - Record key measurements such as arm length, frame width, trigger mechanism, and ball channel size.
  - Optionally, refer to historical diagrams or engineering datasheets for inspiration.
  - In Fusion 360, create the ballista frame and launching arms using your measured dimensions or the provided technical drawing.
  - Model the trigger and loading mechanism to ensure smooth firing of a ping pong ball.
  - Add custom features or decorations in Fusion 360 or Nomad Sculpt.
  - Export your finished model as an STL file, slice and print it, then post-process (remove supports, sand, and paint) for a battle-ready finish.

- **Intermediate:**  
  - Use the provided technical drawing or reference model for the ballista frame and launching arms.
  - Model the main components in Fusion 360, ensuring the channel fits a ping pong ball.
  - Add your own creative modifications or decorations.
  - Export, slice, print, and finish your ballista as above.

**Tip:**  
Beginners and younger makers can focus on the creative aspect, using a provided ballista base and arms to ensure a working launcher. Advanced users can challenge themselves by engineering every part from scratch.

### 2. Prepare for 3D Printing

**Objective**: Export and slice your ballista model for printing.

**Contents:**

1. Export the finished ballista parts in STL format.
2. Import the STL files into your slicer software (e.g., Bambu Studio).
3. Adjust orientation for best print strength and quality.
4. Configure print settings:
   - Layer height: 0.16-0.2mm for strength
   - Infill: 20% or higher for durability
   - Supports: Enable for overhangs and moving parts
5. Slice and preview the print.

### 3. Finish and Test Your Ballista

**Objective**: Post-process and assemble your ping pong ballista.

**Content**:

**Post-Processing**  
   - Remove the print and clean up any supports or rough edges.
   - Sand the surfaces for smooth movement, especially at pivot points and the ball channel.
   - (Optional) Paint your ballista:
     - Use acrylic paint for team colors or battle effects.
     - Add gloss or matte varnish for different finishes.

4. Assemble the ballista, load a ping pong ball, and test fire! Make adjustments for best range and accuracy.

5. Play the Ballista Challenge Game

### Materials Needed
- 3D-printed ballista (or similar ping pong ball launcher)
- Ping pong balls (ammunition)
- Targets (e.g., stacked cups, cardboard towers, or moving objects on strings)
- Measuring tape and protractor (for angle and distance calculations)
- Scoreboard and timer

### Game Rules & Setup

#### 1. Target Knockdown (Static Mode)
- Set up a tower of cups or lightweight blocks as the target.
- Students adjust the ballista’s angle and power to knock down the target in as few shots as possible.

**Scoring:**
- 3 points for a direct hit (target falls completely)
- 1 point for a glancing blow (target is moved but not knocked down)

#### 2. Moving Target Challenge
- Hang a lightweight object (e.g., a paper plate) from a string and set it swinging like a pendulum.
- Students must time their shot to hit the moving target.

**Scoring:**
- 5 points for a direct hit (target stops or is knocked off)
- 2 points for touching the target

#### 3. Distance & Accuracy Trial
- Place a bucket or hoop at different distances from the launcher.
- Students calculate and set the correct angle and force to land the ball inside the target.

**Scoring:**
- 10 points for landing in the farthest target
- 5 points for mid-range
- 2 points for the closest

---

Encourage students to record their scores, adjust their designs or aim, and compete for the highest total!

---

**Tip:**  
- Intermediate students can try with a given technical drawing.
- Advanced students are encouraged to start from scratch, measuring and modeling the ballista for a complete engineering and design experience.

---

## Optional Projects

### Multi-Color Printing
- Use multi-color filament to print the frame, arms, and decorations in different colors.

### Themed Ballista Shields
- Design and print custom shields or banners for your ballista (e.g., medieval, sci-fi, fantasy).

### Ballista Target Range
- Design and print a set of targets or obstacles for competitive ballista battles.
